Translation - Translation is the process of translating the sequence of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule to a sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. 
The genetic code describes the relationship between the sequence of base pairs in a gene and the corresponding amino acid sequence that it encodes.
In the cell cytoplasm, the ribosome reads the sequence of the mRNA in group of three bases to assemble protein.

Transcription - Transcription is the process of making an RNA copy of a gene sequence.
This copy, called a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, leaves the cell nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it directs the synthesis of the protein, which it encodes.
